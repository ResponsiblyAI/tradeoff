        <div>
            <h1>Employee Theft Detection</h1>

            <p>FLOR sells logistics and storage management systems to retail chains all over the world.
            
            <p>Having received numerous complaints that its system is making ‘bad decisions’ in the Oceana region, FLOR revealed a surge in employee merchandise theft in that region that was distorting inventory predictions.
               FLOR designed  an Automated Decision System (ADS) using machine learning for identifying employees at higher risk of stealing. 

            <p>Based on different sources of information, the system can automatically decide which employees should be subject of a face to face investigation, to determine the likelihood that they are in fact engaging in larceny.

        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Ground Truth</h3>

            <p>Our assumption is that 30% of the employees in Oceania have either stolen merchandize or have attempted to steal it <wee class='sick'>a</wee>.
                The other 70% did not <wee class='well'>b</wee>.
 
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Model Predictions</h3>

            <p>In a perfect world, employees who commit or tried to commit larceny are <bg class='sick'>flagged as ones
                    requiring additional
                    investigation</bg>, and only employees who are not at risk of stealing would be <bg>
                    flagged
                    as not requiring an
                    additional investigation</bg>.

        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Model Mistakes</h3>

            <p>But models (and also humans) aren't perfect.

            <p>The model might make a mistake and not flag an employee who is at risk being a thief<wee class='sick bg-well'>c</wee>.

            <p>Or the opposite: the model might flag an employee as one at risk <wee class='well bg-sick'>f</wee>, while in
                fact they have never stolen attempted stealing and thus no additional investigation is required.
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Never Miss a Potential Employee-Thief...</h3>

            <p>One approach would be to have the model flag employees at risk of being thiefs “aggressively”, such that close calls would
                be decided as
                “at risk”, and so the model will rarely miss an employeeat at risk of being a thief.

            <p>We can evaluate this model by counting the number of employees who are correctly and incorrectly flagged
                as employees at
                risk of stealing:

            <div class='metrics'></div>

        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>... Or Avoid Unnecessary Investigations?</h3>

            <p>On the other hand, company’s resources would be allocated to cases where no further investigation is
                required,
                resulting in wasting money. Maybe more importantly, it might burden employees who are
                not truly at
                risk.

            <div class='metrics'></div>

            <p>These issues and trade-offs in model optimization aren't new, but they're brought into focus when we have
                the ability to
                fine-tune exactly how aggressively the model works when flagging employees as being at risk or not.

        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Improve Prediction Power</h3>

            <p>Sometimes it is useful to gather additional data to improve the predictive power of the model.
            <p>But do all data sources contribute equally? What are the meanings and consequences in terms of rights and
                values?

            <div class='metrics'></div>
            <br>


            <form>
                <input type="checkbox" id="child-protection" name="child-protection" value=".2" checked disabled>

        <div>
            <h3>Putting it all Together</h3>

            <p>Now it is your turn to decide (1) which data sources to use and which to exclude; and (2) how
                aggressively the model is
                when flagging an employee at risk of stealing.

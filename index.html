        <div>
            <h1>Child Maltreatment Hotline</h1>

            <p>Following the increased volume of child maltreatment cases during the Covid-19 pandemic, and in light of
                limited
                resources, a Special Committee seeks input from various stakeholders on the design of an Automated
                Decision System (ADS)
                using machine learning for identifying children at risk of maltreatment. The screening system will focus
                on calls placed
                to a hotline, where information of child maltreatment is disclosed to social-worker interns.


            <p>Based on the call and on additional information logged in the system or pulled from government and public
                databases, the
                system will automatically decide which calls to write off as not requiring any additional action, and
                which calls to
                flag as requiring an additional investigation to be performed by a certified social worker.


        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Ground Truth</h3>

            <p>In our data, 30% of the children are at risk <wee class='sick'>a</wee>. Children at risk are those that
                would be removed from home by the child protection agency within two years from the
                call. The other 70% of them are not at risk <wee class='well'>b</wee>.
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Model Predictions</h3>


            <p>In a perfect world, only calls regarding children at risk would be <bg class='sick'>flagged as ones
                    requiring an additional
                    investigation</bg>, and only calls regarding children that are actually not at risk would be <bg>
                    flagged
                    as not requiring an
                    additional investigation</bg>.

        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Model Mistakes</h3>

            <p>But models (and also humans) aren't perfect.

            <p>The model might make a mistake and not flag a child who is at risk <wee class='sick bg-well'>c</wee>.

            <p>Or the opposite: the model might flag a child as one at risk <wee class='well bg-sick'>f</wee>, while in
                fact they are not at risk and no additional investigation is required.
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Never Miss Child at Risk...</h3>

            <p>One approach would be to have the model flag children at risk “aggressively”, such that close calls would
                be decided as
                “at risk”, and so the model will rarely miss a child at risk.

            <p>We can evaluate this model by counting the number of children who are correctly and incorrectly flagged
                as children at
                risk:

            <div class='metrics'></div>

        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>... Or Avoid Unnecessary Investigations?</h3>

            <p>On the other hand, certified social workers would be allocated to cases where no further investigation is
                required,
                resulting in wasting public resources and also in unnecessarily burdening families of children who are
                not truly at
                risk.

            <div class='metrics'></div>

            <p>These issues and trade-offs in model optimization aren't new, but they're brought into focus when we have
                the ability to
                fine-tune exactly how aggressively the model works when flagging children as being at risk or not.

        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Improve Prediction Power</h3>

            <p>Sometimes it is useful to gather additional data to improve the predictive power of the model.
            <p>But do all data sources contribute equally? What are the meanings and consequences in terms of rights and
                values?

            <div class='metrics'></div>

            <h3>Putting it all Together</h3>

            <p>Now it is your turn to decide (1) which data sources to use and which to exclude; and (2) how
                aggressively the model is
                when flagging a call about a child at risk.
